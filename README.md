Overview: 

The objective of this program is to create an automated inventory tracking system for a movie rental shop. There are many ways to go about the problem, ultimately, we decided to make a system that would be easily scalable without compromising efficiency.
A binary search tree, specifically a self-balancing AVL tree, is used to store all of the shop's Movie inventory since it is necessary to store the movies in sorted order. The AVL stores pointers to Movie objects in the data attribute of a Node, defined by a struct nested inside the AVL class. A self-balancing AVL tree is used over a normal BST in order to reduce the time (an average) required to retrieve a movie from the tree to O(log n). This does sacrifice some efficiency for the insert method (and delete though this will not really be used) on average, however, the amount is minimal and the increase in efficiency for the retrieve method is worthwhile. It’s reasonable to expect that a movie will likely only be inserted once while retrieves will happen often for a movie rental store, where a retrieval is needed every time a movie is checked out. Since the sorting requirements for each movie differ based on genre, it is necessary to store the Drama, Comedy, and Classic movies in separate AVL trees. We decided to encapsulate the three different AVL trees in a Stock class, which encompasses the entire inventory for the store.
A HashTable is used to store unique Customer objects, which further store all of the data and transaction data associated with the customers. By using a hash table, the time to obtain the Customer information is constant, O(1), on average and therefore extremely efficient. The hash function for the HashTable class is based on the unique 4-digit customer ID. Assuming each customer is assigned a unique 4-digit ID, the maximum number of customers is only 10,000, which requires a relatively small amount of storage space in most cases. Because of this, we decided to define our hash using an array of 1000 elements (to at least reduce the size some in the case that there is limited space) and use open hashing to store each customer a vector. This means that, in the worst case, each position in the vector could hold a maximum of ten customer objects. This will provide for efficient retrieval from the hash. We also decided to design our hash table such that the has function was an isolated method from the get and insert methods. As of now, the hash function is a simple mod 1000 of the customer ID, but could be easily modified for increased security. 
Inside the Customer class, attributes are used to store the customer ID and name. A vector inside the Customer class is used to store every customer Transaction (Borrow and Return objects), making it easy to check/output the history of a customer. These Borrow and Return classes store a pointer to the Movie involved in the transaction. When the transactions are created, they modify the stock of the Movie object to reflect the transaction. These classes could also be easily extended to include time and date if desired. 
One way we designed the program to be easily scalable is by adding an input class to handle all of the data parsing from the input files and initialization of the data objects, with the help of setters in separate classes. This allows the input class to be minimally modified (or another input class to be added) so that the program can handle other types or formats of data without having to the change the code in outside classes. The factory design pattern was also used in two instances to increase scalability and maintain abstraction between the classes, allowing the Input class to create the appropriate Movie and Transaction objects based on the given file data. The factory design pattern is used for the Transaction class, which the Borrow and Return subclasses inherit from, and the Movie class, which the Drama, Comedy, and Classic subclasses inherit from. Since, in the case of this program, it is not desired to have either Movie or Transaction class objects exist on their own, they are declared as abstract classes and both declare pure virtual methods, which their children must implement. By structuring classes associated with the factory method this way, they are open for extension (for ex, a new category/child of Movie can be easily added) but closed to modification, since only the factory class would require a small amount of additional code, and thus adhere to the open-close principle. The way the program is structured also makes it easy to add an abstract Media class, which the Movie class would inherit from, allowing the type of media managed by the store to be extended to other types of media (Music, Books, etc). Since we decided not to actually implement this, the AVL in our design stores pointers to Movie objects in its Nodes. This would simply be changed to store pointers to Media objects and a Media class could be added if it was desired to extend the program to other media types.
        	The main (businessLogic) is simple because almost all of the program’s operational components are abstracted in the classes (see UML and main below). In the main, input file streams are created to read in each of the three files, a Stock object (inventory) is created to hold the movies, a HashTable object (customers) is created to hold the customer data, and an Input object (in) is created to input the data. After this, the input functions are called to read in the files for the data and commands, the file streams and inventory/customers objects are passed as arguments, and the program is complete.
